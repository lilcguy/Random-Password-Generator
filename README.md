# Random-Password-Generator

## Description
A random password generator that allows the user to control whether a randomly generated password of a specified length will contain upper or lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## What was your motivation?
This project was an exercise in what I've learned about JavaScript so far, including functions, for loops, booleans, and if statements. 

## Why did you build this?
This project was completed to push myself and test my knowledge. I had no idea where to even begin when I started, and by the end, with much help, I found myself triumphant.

## What problem does this solve?

Building this random password generator was an exercise in practicality: For security reasons, a company may benefit from having an internal password generator that can generate passwords with a specified length and designated parameters.

## What did you learn?
I learned that a function can be long, and have a lot of different things going on inside it.
I had a handful of checks, which I suspect could have been condensed, but I chose not to just because I feared I would break something. On the final stretch, I found myself bumping into small errors, such as incorrectly referenced variables, or even a console log blocking the whole function because it was referencing a variable that didn't exist. A missed plus sign caused an error. A missed capital letter caused an error. I felt that this project was way out of my depth. So I learned to ask for help with the resources I had available to me.


## Usage
Press the button and view the console.
